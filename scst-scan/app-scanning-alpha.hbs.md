# Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan 2.0 (alpha)

>**Important** This component is in Alpha, which means that it is still in
>active development by VMware and might be subject to change at any point. Users
>might encounter unexpected behavior due to capability gaps. This is an opt-in
>component to gather early feedback from alpha testers and is not installed by
>default with any profile.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

SCST - Scan 2.0 is responsible for providing the framework to scan applications
for their security posture. Scanning container images for known Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) implements this framework. This framework
simplifies integration for new plug-ins by allowing users to integrate new scan
engines by minimizing the scope of the scan engine to only scan and push results
to an OCI compliant registry.

During scanning:

- A `GrypeImageVulnerabilityScan` creates the child resource `ImageVulnerabilityScan`.
- The `ImageVulnerabilityScan` then creates a [Tekton PipelineRun](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelineruns/) which instantiates a Pipeline. The Pipeline Spec specifies the tasks `workspace-setup-task`, `scan-task`, and `publish-task` to set up the workspace and environment configuration, run a scan, and publish results to an OCI compliant registry.
- Each Task contains steps which execute commands to achieve the goal of the Task.
- The PipelineRun creates corresponding TaskRuns for every Task in the Pipeline and executes them.
- A Tekton Sidecar as a [no-op sidecar](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/cmd/nop/README.md#stopping-sidecar-containers) triggers Tekton's injected sidecar cleanup.

>**Note** SCST - Scan 2.0 is in Alpha and supersedes the [SCST - Scan component](overview.hbs.md).

## <a id="features"></a>Features

SCST - Scan 2.0 includes the following features:

- Tekton is used as the orchestrator of the scan to align with overall Tanzu Application Platform use of Tekton for multi-step activities.
- New scans are defined as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that represent specific scanners, such as GrypeImageVulnerabilityScan. Mapping logic turns the domain-specific specifications into a Tekton PipelineRun.
- CycloneDX-formatted scan results are pushed to an OCI registry for long-term storage.

    ```

## <a id="config-ns"></a> Configure namespace

The following sections describe how to configure service accounts and registry credentials.

The following access is required:

  - Read access to the registry containing the Tanzu Application Platform bundles. This is the registry from the [Relocate images to a registry](../../docs-tap/install.hbs.md#relocate-images-to-a-registry) step or `registry.tanzu.vmware.com`.
  - Read access to the registry containing the image to scan, if scanning a private image
  - Write access to the registry to which results are published

1. Create a secret `scanning-tap-component-read-creds` with read access to the registry containing the Tanzu Application Platform bundles. This pulls the SCST - Scan 2.0 images.

    >**Important** If you followed the directions for [Install Tanzu Application Platform](../install-intro.hbs.md), skip this step and use the `tap-registry` secret with your service account.

    ```console
    read -s TAP_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
    kubectl create secret docker-registry scanning-tap-component-read-creds \
      --docker-username=TAP-REGISTRY-USERNAME \
      --docker-password=$TAP_REGISTRY_PASSWORD \
      --docker-server=TAP-REGISTRY-URL \
      -n DEV-NAMESPACE
    ```

    Where `DEV-NAMESPACE` is the developer namespace where scanning occurs.

2. If you are scanning a private image, create a secret `scan-image-read-creds` with read access to the registry containing that image.

    >**Important** If you followed the directions for [Install Tanzu Application Platform](../install-intro.hbs.md), you can skip this step and use the `targetImagePullSecret` secret with your service account as referenced in your tap-values.yaml [here](../install.hbs.md#full-profile).

    ```console
    read -s REGISTRY_PASSWORD
    kubectl create secret docker-registry scan-image-read-creds \
      --docker-username=REGISTRY-USERNAME \
      --docker-password=$REGISTRY_PASSWORD \
      --docker-server=REGISTRY-URL \
      -n DEV-NAMESPACE
    ```

3. Create a secret `write-creds` with write access to the registry for the scanner to upload the scan results to.

    ```console
    read -s WRITE_PASSWORD
    kubectl create secret docker-registry write-creds \
      --docker-username=WRITE-USERNAME \
      --docker-password=$WRITE_PASSWORD \
      --docker-server=DESTINATION-REGISTRY-URL \
      -n DEV-NAMESPACE
    ```

4. Create the service account `scanner` which enables SCST - Scan 2.0 to pull the image to scan. Attach the read secret created earlier under `imagePullSecrets` and the write secret under `secrets`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: scanner
      namespace: DEV-NAMESPACE
    imagePullSecrets:
    - name: scanning-tap-component-read-creds
    secrets:
    - name: scan-image-read-creds
    ```

    Where:
    - `imagePullSecrets.name` is the name of the secret used by the component to pull the scan component image from the registry.
    - `secrets.name` is the name of the secret used by the component to pull the image to scan. This is required if the image you are scanning is private.

5. Create the service account `publisher` which enables SCST - Scan 2.0 to push the scan results to a user specified registry.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: publisher
      namespace: DEV-NAMESPACE
    imagePullSecrets:
    - name: scanning-tap-component-read-creds
    secrets:
    - name: write-creds
    ```

    Where:
    - `imagePullSecrets.name` is the name of the secret used by the component to pull the scan component image from the registry.
    - `secrets.name` is the name of the secret used by the component to publish the scan results.

## <a id="scan-image"></a> Scan an image

The following section describes how to scan an image with SCST - Scan 2.0.

### <a id="retrieve-digest"></a> Retrieving an image digest

SCST - Scan 2.0 custom resources require the digest form of the URL. For example,  `nginx@sha256:aa0afebbb3cfa473099a62c4b32e9b3fb73ed23f2a75a65ce1d4b4f55a5c2ef2`.

Use the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to pull and inspect an image digest:

```console
docker pull nginx:latest
docker inspect --format='\{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' nginx:latest
```

Alternatively, you can install [krane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/krane) to retrieve the digest without pulling the image:

```console
krane digest nginx:latest
```

### <a id="using-grype"></a> Using the provided Grype scanner

The following sections describe how to use Grype with SCST - Scan 2.0.

#### <a id="sample-grype"></a> Sample Grype scan

To create a sample Grype scan:

1. Create a file named `grype-image-vulnerability-scan.yaml`. Configure the `image` and `scanResults.location`:

    ```yaml

    NAME        SCANRESULT                           SCANNEDIMAGE          SUCCEEDED   REASON
    grypescan   registry/project/scan-results@digest nginx:latest@digest   True        Succeeded

    ```

### <a id="integrate-scanner"></a> Integrate your own scanner

To scan with any other scanner, use the generic `ImageVulnerabilityScan`.
ImageVulnerabilityScans can also change the version of a scanner or customize
the behavior of provided scanners.

ImageVulnerabilityScans allow you to define your scan as a [Tekton step](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#defining-steps)

#### <a id="sample-img-vuln"></a> Sample ImageVulnerabilityScan

To create a sample Sample ImageVulnerabilityScan:

1. Create a file named `image-vulnerability-scan.yaml`. Configure the `image`, `scanResults.location` of the scan, and define the scanner `image`, `command`, and `args` for your scanner `step`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: app-scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
    kind: ImageVulnerabilityScan
    metadata:

      image: nginx@sha256:...
      scanResults:
        location: registry/project/scan-results
      serviceAccountNames:
        scanner: scanner
        publisher: publisher
      steps:
      - name: scan
        image: anchore/grype:latest
        command: ["grype"]
        args:
        - registry:$(params.image)
        - -o
        - cyclonedx
        - --file
        - $(params.scan-results-path)/scan.cdx
    ```

    Where `DEV-NAMESPACE` is the developer namespace where scanning occurs.

    **Note**: Do not define `write-certs` or `cred-helper` as step names. These names are already used in steps during scanning.

#### <a id="img-vuln-config-options"></a> Configuration options

This section lists optional and required ImageVulnerabilityScan specifications fields.

Required fields:

- `image` is the registry URL and digest of the image to scan.

### <a id="debugging-commands"></a> Debugging commands

The following sections describe commands you can run to get logs and details about scanning errors.

### <a id="debug-source-image-scan"></a> Debugging resources

If a resource fails or has errors, inspect the resource.

To get status conditions on a resource:

```console
kubectl describe RESOURCE RESOURCE-NAME -n DEV-NAMESPACE
```

Where:

- `RESOURCE` is one of the following: `GrypeImageVulnerabilityScan`, `ImageVulnerabilityScan`, `PipelineRun`, or `TaskRun`.
- `RESOURCE-NAME` is the name of the `RESOURCE`.
- `DEV-NAMESPACE` is the name of the developer namespace you want to use.

### <a id="debugging-scan-pods"></a> Debugging scan pods

To get error logs from a pod when scan pods fail:

```console
kubectl logs SCAN-POD-NAME -n DEV-NAMESPACE
```

Where `SCAN-POD-NAME` is the name of the scan pod.

For information
about debugging Kubernetes pods, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://jamesdefabia.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_logs/).

A scan run that has an error means that one of the following step containers has a failure:

- `step-write-certs`
- `step-cred-helper`
- `step-publisher`
- `sidecar-sleep`
- `working-dir-initializer`

To determine which step container had a [failed exit code](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#specifying-onerror-for-a-step):

```
kubectl get taskrun TASKRUN-NAME -o json | jq .status
```

Where `TASKRUN-NAME` is the name of the TaskRun.

To inspect a specific step container in a pod:

```console
kubectl logs scan-pod-name -n DEV-NAMESPACE -c step-container-name
```

Where `DEV-NAMESPACE` is your developer namespace.

For information about debugging a TaskRun, see the [Tekton documentation](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/taskruns/#debugging-a-taskrun).

### <a id="view-scan-controller-manager-logs"></a> Viewing the Scan-Controller manager logs

To retrieve scan-controller manager logs:

```console
kubectl logs deployment/app-scanning-controller-manager -n app-scanning-system
```

To tail scan-controller manager logs:

```console
kubectl logs -f deployment/app-scanning-controller-manager -n app-scanning-system
